                Managed a team of nine students at Trinity College Dublin working with IBM on a project that uses Natural Language Understanding to analyse the dynamics in 
                open-source communities on GitHub. To ascertain whether the comments were favourable or bad,  we gathered hundreds of thousands of comments from thousands of issues 
                and pull requests. To boost the longevity of open-source projects, we expect that this type of study will assist communities in identifying potential reasons
                 why people might end up leaving the community.
